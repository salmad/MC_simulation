# MC_simulation

Mad_MC is a highly versatile software package for performing and analyzing scientific many-particle simulations of coarse-grained atomistic or bead-spring models as they are used in soft-matter research in physics, chemistry and molecular biology. It can be used to simulate systems such as polymers, liquid crystals, colloids and biological systems, for example microgels, DNA and lipid membranes.

Mad_MC is free, open-source software published under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It is written using Monte-Carlo ideology and can easily be  parallelized and can be employed on desktop machines, convenience clusters as well as on supercomputers with hundreds of CPUs. The parallel code is controlled via *.cpp file which uses C-code from other files. Although it is C-based code , it has the functionality of scripting languages and high efficiency and flexibility.
