# MC_simulation

Mad_MC is a Monte-Carlo based software package for performing and analyzing scientific many-particle simulations of coarse-grained atomistic or bead-spring models used in soft-matter research in physics, chemistry and molecular biology. It can be used to simulate systems such as polymers, liquid crystals, colloids and biological systems, for example microgels, DNA and lipid membranes.

Monte-Carlo ideology offers several advantages:

1. Enables accurate calculations of free energy landscapes, barries and adding bias potentials.

2. Simple implementation of constraints, ability to fix collective variable such as center of mass, reaction coordinate.

3. Simulating Grand canonical, semi-grand canonical and other ensembles.

4. Easy parallelisation.

Mad_MC is free, open-source software published under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It is written using Monte-Carlo ideology and can easily be  parallelized and can be employed on desktop machines, convenience clusters as well as on supercomputers with hundreds of CPUs. The parallel code is controlled via *.cpp file which uses C-code from other files. Although it is C-based code , it has the functionality of scripting languages and high efficiency and flexibility.

Enjoy!
